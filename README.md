I'm Software Engineer 😄 currently working at Globant for Autodesk with specialization in mobile development for Android. I love mobile development in any platform because of lot of interesting challenges.

I also have knowledge in Artificial Intelligence with specialization in Deep Learning for Image Processing.

I know many different programming languages.

Sometimes I like to solve programming problems for competitive programming in HackeRank, LeetCode, URI, UVA Online, etc. During my collegue time I was a ACM ICPC contestant for a peruvian team.

If you have any question related to Android or Artificial Intelligence you can send me a message to this email: `jjorge.rc93@gmail.com` 📫
